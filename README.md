# Used-Car-Price-Predictor
Here I worked with data from the theoretical Rusty Bargain used car sales service. This was project 11 for Yandex’s Practicum, where I worked with them on developing an app to attract new customers. Specifically, the purpose here was to develop a model that could quickly find the market value of a car.  Rusty Bargain specified that they wanted: the highest quality prediction, a fast-working model, and a model that wouldn’t take too much time to train.

Note: Data file was too large to upload to Github
